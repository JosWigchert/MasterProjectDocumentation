The talk about iridium satellite hacking mentioned the need for an extrenal Bias-T (probably only when using an active antenna to power)

"In GPS radios, a bias-T injects DC power into the antenna line to supply power to the active GPS antenna, ensuring proper operation of the antenna's internal components."

They also mentioned that there are not that many "cheap" active iridium antennas as of 17 aug 2016
