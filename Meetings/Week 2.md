## Questions

- When do I know that I have good/enough papers?
	- while adding approuches, less new approsals you will find. when it there is nothing new we can stop
- When should I start formulating the research question in a research proposal? 
	- send action points remember to send the preparation pahse reports
- Is there a template/ example of a literature review?
	- 
- Can I include the fade print paper as it is currently under review and not published yet?
	- yes


dont exclude the csi

csi collaboration from transmitter -> dont want
single receive or multiple -> we want single receiver
similarities to ans -> kkeepit at the how it works not the mathematics


localization extract the multiple and the possible cooperation of the transmitter
localization doesnt match 
fingerprinting dont having to recognising all things
try to find different papers with tdifferent usecases
try focus on spoofing detection

spoofing, exact device or group of devices

action points
- group table
- search for spoofing detection papers
- have a look at the propposals
- share the overleaf when i start
