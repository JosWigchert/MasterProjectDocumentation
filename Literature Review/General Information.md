CSI:
$Y = H * X + N$
with:
$Y =$ Received signal
$H =$ Channel Frequency Response (CFR)
$X =$ Transmit signal
$N =$ Noise


Channel Frequency Response (CFR) or CSI has 30 values which can be used for detection or other things

> civilian GPS signals are now being transmitted on other bands such as L2 and L5 in addition to the legacy L1
